# Wing build


## Mould Prep
1. Waxed with TR-108 wax and buffed off without letting it dry (as per instructions). 8 coats in total over a week.
2. Moulds painted with Molatow Acrylic paint and Molatow Acrylic clear coat where naked carbon to be revealed. Paint not pre-heated. Paint lay-up thickly...

## Layup 
On each side wet out with Wests Systems 105 epoxy and 205 slow hardener 1:5 ratio approx 350g resin:
1. Glass tissue as veil cloth
2. 2 x 1300mm 400g biaxial stitched carbon overlapping in centre 600mm (45/bias). Hard-rolled with threaded steel roller.
3. 3 x 1" wide 400g stiched carbon uni 0-90 (1750mm, 820mm, 470mm with longest closest to outer surface). Hard-rolled with threaded steel roller.
4. 400g biaxial stitched carbon 80mm wide centred as a 'doubler' for reinforcing hard-points. Hard-rolled with threaded steel roller.
5. 2 x 175g kevlar 45/bias 30mm wide per hinge for live hinges centred on hinge-line 400mm long. 8 strips in total. Hard-rolled with threaded steel roller.
6. Peel ply
7. Breath cloth
8. Sucked down to ~16" murcury vacuum. Struggled to get any more due to vac leaks :( 
9. Covered in elec blanket on max setting (perhaps 40deg C?) for 8 hours to cure.

## Post layup
1. Vac bagged in 'half-core' 9mm thick green foam with yellow PU glue and let cure.
2. Trimmed flush with mould flange with hotwire using alu foil flashing tape to protect corian flange.
3. Servo pockets a wires pre-set into the foam and sealed off with blue tape to stop glue leaking into pockets an channels
4. Cut out main shear-web channel 13mm wide along the 40% chord line
5. Solid Pine hard points 24mmx50mm glued into top and bottom halves and planed flush with flange. 30mm from LE and 40mm from TE.
6. Slightly over-filled each side with 'grey stuff' (Free-foam air epoxy sculpting dough) to form shear-web with expansion slots. 
7. Drag spar: foam noodles 820mm length 9.5mm dia tapering to 6mm dia carbon socked, wet-out, and placed 8mm forward of the hingeline.
8. Flap LE spar: foam noodles 820mm length 6.5mm dia tapering to 3mm dia carbon socked, wet-out, and placed 5mm behind of the hingeline.
9. A 2mm bead of splooge glue mix of west's and wests 403 glue powder ran around the edges and on each side of the noodles and on hard points.
10. yellow PU smeared on one side of green foam cores
11. Mould closed with two locator pins (one at each end) and mould closed with 12 F-cramps progressively tightened.
12. Cured at ambient temp 18 deg C.
12. Mould split and wing extracted 18 hours later.

## Result:
* 1.2kg untrimmed weight
* Terrible stickup... Very difficult to split moulds!! Paint stuck everywhere. surface finish a mess... had to fill and re-paint. 
* Main wing torsional stiffness is excellent!
* Control surface torsional stiffness is excellent!
* Main wing longitudinal bending stiffness is acceptable if a little flexi. Ok for a mid weight general purpose DS ship of < 3kgs?
* 

## What to do differently next time
* heat paint and build it up in very light layers! or use PVA or both.
* Use more or a higher modulus carbon UNI for spar caps to increase stiffness
* Dont do overlapping centre sections of carbon - just use single piece. Easier to trim in mould.
* Dont wait too long before trimming and joining! days not weeks...
