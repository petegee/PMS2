# Horizontal Stab

## Construction
1. CNC cut green foam, and hand-shaped half-round tips.
2. 50mmx10mm wide Paulownia hard-points trimmed to profile before bagging at 15mm from LE, and 46 from TE.

## Layup
1. 1x50g glass veil cloth
2. 1x200g carbon weave at 45/bias
3. 4x16k adjacent carbon tow span-wise top and bottom spar-caps
4. 1x175g bias kevlar live hinge cut

## Post-Bagging
* attached with 2x 25mm m4 countersunk stainless steel screws.
* flap cut 26mm from TE at wing root and green foam picked out 5mm back on LE of flap and back-filled with epoxy/glue-powder mix to "close the triangle"

## Result:
* Plenty strong enough longitudinally
* Plenty strong enough torsionally.
* flap just strong enough torsionally after back-filling with splooge mix.
* bit of a bump in profile where the carbon tow was placed.
* weight: 45g
