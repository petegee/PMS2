# P.M.S. mk2 

Poor Mans' Sloper Mk2 (PMS 2) is a scaled-down to 2 meter version of the PMS 3 meter slope-soarer original designed and built by Dave Pope, which was a 2-piece vac-bagged wing. The PMS 2 is intended to be a single-peice wing, heavy-weight, high-aspect, Dynamic Soaring glider which is built to be very strong and break the 300MPH barrier for local Wellington DS pilots.

The initial prototype PMS 2 was built by Dave Pope with a vac-bagged foam-cored triple-tapered elliptical plan-form with a fuselage mold built from a turned wooden plug and created from poly resin and chopped-matt glass. The air-foils were designed by Sean Malloney and are designed first and foremost for Dynamic Soaring, producing excellent DS performance from 200-400MPH with average front-side sloping performance yet being docile enough to slow down for launch and landing.

The wing moulds were build several years later by Pete Glassey. The wing design and mold CAD work was done by Joe Wurts. The CAM 3D CNC milling was done by Peter Williams. The moulds were milled from laminated corian bench-top material.

Note: this is based on original triple-tapered prototype planform; which should be close enough as a starting point.
