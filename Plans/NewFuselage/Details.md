# New Fuselage Details

A new fuselage is being designed and a mold will be machined for tooling. This improves the previous fuselage mold by:
* A new mold. The old one fair buggered...
* Make the nose moment longer to accomodate easier CG acheival
* Shorten the tail moment by the same amount to accomodate easier CG acheival and to reflect the new slightly bigger tail
* Wider and deeper to enable easier installation of gear and to improve the strength.
* Built in fairing - easier construction 
* Built in correct incidence with correctly mated tail and wing mounts - easier construction 
* Bigger fin for more yaw stability and easier install of tail servo
 

## General Dimensions
* length: 1200mm 
* Nose moment (from LE of wing) 330mm
* Wing root chord (saddle length) 170mm
* Tail moment (from wing TE to stab LE) 606mm
* Tail mounted 150mm above fuselage datum
* Incidence angle (wing/stab) 0 degrees
