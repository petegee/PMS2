# Wing Details

Once removed from mold, you must trim 10mm off the trailing edge to get the correct wing planform.

## Specifications
* Flaps = 400mm length starting 30mm from root
* Ailerons = 400mm length starting from end of flap (should end 165mm from tip)
* Hingeline is straight at 20% chord and bottom-hinged
* Max thickness is at 41% chord (spar should be centred on or close to this line and sweep back)
* Hard-points 23mm wide 50mm length, 30mm from LE and 40mm from TE

## Wing internals
Several options here:
1. Full "half-core" method blue/green foam in which case a solid shear-web may only be needed for extreme builds
2. Conventional hollow-core. 
   * 13mm wide shear-web is required following the max thickness either in two or three sections per side. This could be pine (fitted/glued in top and then bottom, planed flush with mold face, and glued together when joining), 45 grain balsa, carbon-socked noodle.
   * Carbon socked foam noodles required for drag spar 9mm diameter tapering down to 6mm diameter @ 820mm in length
   * Carbon socked foam noodles required aileron/flap facings 6.5mm diameter tapering down to 3.5mm diameter @ 820mm in length
   * foam, core-matt, balsa core material is required.
